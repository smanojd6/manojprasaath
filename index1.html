			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="images/LlL.jpg" alt="">
			<p>About myself, turning back at the path that I have come past; I have been moulded by each and every good and bad experience. That’s what made me who I am now. 
				I am a believer of smart work and I’ve been learning to get hold of both these talents to improve my life. 
				There are instances that happen in life to teach us lessons, like wise such events have taught me that I have to develop my self confidence level. <br><br>>Now I finally believe that. From my O/Ls days I’ve been working hard to get to this place, sometimes life tested with very tough situations, I went through ups and downs. 
				But they never held me back from achieving what I have. “One has to believe in himself more than anything” is what I taught myself. <br><br>And I’m interested in living and experiencing what is there up ahead in look life. 
				I have very good friends, very supportive brother and awesome parents who have been with me with my every step. Without them I wouldn’t have made this far.
